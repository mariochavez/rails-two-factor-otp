# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# The following keys must be escaped otherwise they will not be retrieved by
# the default I18n backend:
#
# true, false, on, off, yes, no
#
# Instead, surround them with single quotes.
#
# en:
#   'true': 'foo'
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at https://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

        step3: Enter this code to verify that is you and login succesful.
        additional_explanation: >
          On every login to this application, you will be required to enter a one-time code generated by an app in your phone.
          This will prevent from someone else who guessed your password to login without this 2FA code.
          Setting up 2FA takes a few minutes, we will walk you through it.

          If you have an app like Duo, 1Password or Google authenticator you are all set. If you don't have a two-factor authentication app, we recommend an app called <a href="https://authy.com/" target="_blank">Authy</a>. It is frees for iOS and Android.
